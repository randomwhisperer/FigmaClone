Advanced Canvas Features:

    Implement real-time collaboration using WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for multi-user editing.
    Add infinite canvas with smooth zooming/panning using libraries like Konva.js or PixiJS.
    Support vector editing (Bezier curves, node-based paths) with SVG integration.

Enhanced Toolset:

    Introduce advanced shape tools: polygons, stars, arrows, and boolean operations (union, subtract).
    Add image import, crop, and filter effects (e.g., blur, contrast) using HTML5 Canvas or WebGL.
    Implement a pen tool for freeform drawing with stroke smoothing.

Improved Layer System:

    Add nested layers and group functionality with drag-and-drop reordering.
    Implement layer effects (shadows, gradients, opacity) and blending modes.
    Enable layer locking, visibility toggles, and non-destructive editing.

UI/UX Upgrades:

    Add undo/redo functionality with Redux middleware (e.g., redux-undo).
    Introduce keyboard shortcuts and context menus for faster workflows.
    Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet support using CSS Grid or Tailwind CSS.

Prototyping & Animation:

    Add prototyping mode for linking artboards and creating interactive transitions.
    Integrate micro-animations for UI elements using Framer Motion or GSAP.
    Support exporting designs as animated GIFs or videos.

Asset Management:

    Add a component library for reusable design elements (e.g., buttons, icons).
    Implement a design system with style guides (colors, typography, spacing) synced across projects.
    Enable cloud storage for assets using Firebase or AWS S3.

Performance Optimization:

    Optimize canvas rendering with WebGL or OffscreenCanvas for large projects.
    Use lazy loading for assets and memoization (React.memo, useMemo) for components.
    Implement state persistence with IndexedDB or localStorage for offline support.

Integration & Export:

    Add export options for SVG, PNG, PDF, and CSS code snippets.
    Integrate with third-party tools (e.g., Zeplin, Slack) via APIs.
    Support importing Figma/Sketch files using file parsers or APIs.
